Following discussions a partnership was established with an agreement to develop a recreational facility on the site.</p><p>The project brief aimed to provide an inviting recreational space for both local residents and members of Milpara Aged Care Facility. The design proposal needed to considered affordable elements which promoted self paced physical activity, health and mobility benefits for all. This was constrained by a limited budget of $50,000.</p><p>The location is prominent and easily accessible for all by pedestrians, public transport and vehicles.

Taking into consideration feedback previously provided by the Campbelltown community and more specifically local residents of Anderson Court, staff developed a draft plan according to the consultation comments and suggestions.<br/><br/>The conceptual design layout was inspired by the Campbelltown City Council logo which showcases the cities link between the hills, river and the sun. The soft shapes of the logo are highlighted in the design with the bright fun colours blue, yellow and green. <br/><br/>Playspace blades: Aligned within organic curves inspired by the council logo and visual cues help connect the vertical timber blades that are featured in the adjacent newly renovated Library. These posts encourage children develop their imaginative play while also using their motor skills through developing games and playing within the sculptural posts.  <br/><br/>Artificial grass mounds: The mounds are shaded by nearby mature trees and act as alternative seating and personal space for people to read a book or relax. The Mound is made from a rubber soft fall making it suitable for jumping, running up, sitting and most importantly maintenance. <br/><br/>Shade panels and seating: These panels are temporary vertical structure designed by council to act as shade for seating. The panels can be removed once newly planted trees mature and provide natural shade. Seating in the form of coloured benches or grass mounds are provided throughout the landscape space for visitors to rest, interact, socialize and supervise.  <br/><br/>Recycled play equipment: To create a cost effective Playspace the design incorporated some of the existing play equipment by relocating the pieces to form a balancing course. </p></div>"
